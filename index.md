<b>S.U.R.F.E.R</b> is an acronym for: 
<b>S</b>oftware-Defined <b>U</b>HF <b>R</b>FID 
<b>F</b>lexible <b>E</b>conomical <b>R</b>eader.

Broadly, the goal of the S.U.R.F.E.R. program is to increase 
the proliferation of UHF RFID and other long-range backscatter 
technologies worldwide.

#What is UHF RFID?

UHF RFID is a technology in which a reader and a tag communicate at a 
distance of up to 2 to 20 meters, depending on the specifics of the setup.
The reader interrogates the tag to obtain information such as a unique ID
or environmental characteristics, such as temperature or air pressure.
UHF RFID tags are incredibly cheap, ranging down to $0.05 per tag in bulk,
and often come with adhesive backing, meaning that they can be deployed
quickly and <i>en masse</i>.

#Where is UHF RFID used?

Typically, UHF RFID is used when precise identification is needed at a distance.
While computer vision is increasingly used for this purpose, privacy concerns
and lack of repeatable external identifiers means that UHF RFID is still 
valuable in several key market segments.

#Are there other types of RFID?

Yes, High-Frequency (HF) tags are often used for hotel key card and book tracking.
Low-frequency (LF) tags are often used for animal tracking and key fobs.
The ranges and data rates of these systems are substantially smaller than for UHF RFID; 
however, the lower frequency confers other advantages such as performance near objects
made of metal or living tissue.
